WASD or Arrow key to move
Space to jump
Use mouse to aim and click left mouse button to shoot

Note setting of the game is underwater so the floaty control is intentional
I haven't had that much time to spend on the game so the game is mostly unfinished

spear is going off the game boundary. 

sometimes the player can jump more than once in the air. i think this has to do with colliding with a platform against the players side.

The spear returns a little slowly

You definitely need a couple more levels, and like, a small tutorial for what your supposed to be doing but its a very cool idea! 

A recommendation I have is to keep on having fish spawn in or cut to another stage in rapid fire to give that arcade feel I think you're going for. Good stuff 

If its intentional cool, you can walk into enemies with the spear and they die. Cool art and mechanics. I really like the jump and spear launching.

It would be cool if you made its so the longer you hold on the mouse button, the longer it shoots. I like the jump mechanic alot as well because it feels like you're swimming. Having the spear not come back to the player would add a layer of difficulty to the game.
